# Measurement Automation of Microscope Illumination Power and Stability


## Summary
The [QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/) power and stability assessment protocol [(*Protocols.io link*)](https://www.protocols.io/private/ACED53063BFC11ECA98F0A58A9FEAC02) requires measurements repeated over different conditions for each microscope and its respective excitation light sources. Therefore, extensive time will be consumed, if the measurements are conducted manually in a sequential manner. However, most modern microscopes provide an automation programing interface capable of communicating with a calibrated, external power sensor. The automated measurement has a two-fold aim: to make time-intensive measurements feasible through automatic interleaving of the different measurement conditions and to improve reproducibility by repeating measurements in an identical fashion.<br>
- QUAREP LiMi provides <a href="/Microscope_Systems/">examples</a> (scripts, documentation and videos) that can be adapted to a series of microscope/power meter combinations.
- A high-level description defining the automation procedure can be found [here](Automation_Full.md).

## Laser Safety
-	The intense lasers, lamps, and other light sources used for microscopy are frequently eye safety hazards. Follow proper laser safety protocols for your equipment and situation.
-	Measuring high-intensity light sources exposes the operator to potentially hazardous optical power levels. This procedure presents a potentially radiation hazard. Specific parameters of the radiation are determined by the product used. Please refer to the documentation provided by the manufacturer for additional warnings and PPE requirements (e.g. laser safety goggles). Consult with your local Laser Safety Officer or refer to your laboratory safety documentation for more information.
-	Consult Laser Safety Standards ANSI Z136 in North America and SUVA 66049.D in Europe, BS EN 60825-1 in the UK. Additionally, laser safety is covered by IEC norm 60825-1 and LED eye safety is covered by IEC norm 62471 for Europe. The documents applicable to your region will be available through your local designated Laser Safety Officer or Radiation Safety Office for your institution.
