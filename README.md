# Measurement Automation of Microscope Illumination Power and Stability


## Summary
The [QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/) power and stability assessment protocol ***[external protocol link here]*** requires measurements repeated over different conditions for each microscope and its respective excitation light sources. Therefore, extensive time will be consumed, if the measurements are conducted manually in a sequential manner. However, most modern microscopes provide an automation programing interface capable of communicating with a calibrated, external power sensor. The automated measurement has a two-fold aim: to make time-intensive measurements feasible through automatic interleaving of the different measurement conditions and to improve reproducibility by repeating measurements in an identical fashion.<br>
QUAREP LiMi provides examples (scripts, documentation and videos) that can be adapted to a series of <a href="/Microscope_Systems/"> microscope/power meter</a> combinations.
