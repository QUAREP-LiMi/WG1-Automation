# Measurement Automation of Microscope Illumination Power and Stability


## Summary
The QUAREP-LiMi power and stability assessment protocol [external protocol link] requires measurements repeated over different conditions for each microscope and its respective excitation light sources. Therefore, extensive time will be consumed, if the measurements are conducted manually in a sequential manner. However, most modern microscopes provide an automation programing interface capable of communicating with a calibrated, external power sensor. The automated measurement has a two-fold aim: to make time-intensive measurements feasible through automatic interleaving of the different measurement conditions and to improve reproducibility by repeating measurements in an identical fashion.
QUAREP LiMi provides examples (scripts, documentation and videos) that can be adapted to a series of <a href="/Microscope_Systems/"> microscopes</a>.
