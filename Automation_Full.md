# Automated Laser Intensity Measurement
## Introduction
Light microscopy setups frequently rely on multiple, laser-based light sources. Their short- (5 min) and long-term (120 min) illumination powers and stabilities need to be assessed through regular measurements with an external, calibrated power sensor to ensure quality and measurement reproducibility.
The assessment protocols, if taken without some additional considerations, can be very time and resource consuming. For instance, the long term assessment, conducted on a system containing 3 lasers would require at least 6 h to complete.
