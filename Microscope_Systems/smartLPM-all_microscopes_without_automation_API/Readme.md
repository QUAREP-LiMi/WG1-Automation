SmartLPM: Automatic power measurement and stability assessment for microscopees with no automation functionality.

The accuracy of a power measurement depends on the correct configuration of the light source and the meter device. Specifically, the illumination wavelegth determines the photocurrent and a wrong setting bring an incorrect estimation of the optical power. In addition, if the set powers (e.g. 30%) it is necessary to ensure that the stored values match the illumination settings.

SmartLPM provides an interface to define how the illumination series will be generated at the microscope. This information allows the automatic classification of the different illumination pulses. A correction mechanism also applies the correct responsitities according to the set wavelengths.

At the microscope there is no need for programming interfaces (APIs). Instead, the illumination series has to be configured independently. These configurations can be saved and reloaded under the microscopy software for future power measurements. Some functions available to configure illumination series are the experiment manager (Olympus), the Live Data Mode (Leica) or the Experiment Designer (Zeiss). Other alternatives, as combining tile scans with time series allow multiple illumination patterns.
