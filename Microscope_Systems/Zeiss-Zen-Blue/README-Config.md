The measurementConfig.csv file has to be saved alongside the macro (Python) files

- The csv file tells the scripts where files are and how to run the experiments. 
- No spaces allowed after the commas

The Zen macro has to be in a specific path, see instructions inside each folder.
The other files can be placed flexibly, but the paths have to be updated in the config file.
