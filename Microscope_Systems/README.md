# Measurement Automation Use Cases
The examples below run successfully in specific microscopes. We provide them in the hope that they are helpful, but we cannot provide support or warranty of any kind. Differences between similar microscopes (filters, light paths, etc.) are to be expected and the usually minor adaptations needed from one to another require the understanding of the code. While unlikely, damage to the equipment caused by wrong edits or by unforeseen circumstances is still possible. Proceed at your own risk, following the local safety regulations and  by by ensuring complete understanding of the programs prior to their execution. In particular, for testing purposes we strongly advise to employ low laser power settings and reduced number of loops.
